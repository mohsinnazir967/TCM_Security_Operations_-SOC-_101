# Introduction to Phishing


**Module Goal**: Understand the fundamentals of phishing, why it's so prevalent, and how SOC analysts can effectively defend against it.

## Objectives

- Understand phishing fundamentals and why it’s a major organizational threat.
- Learn a strong methodology for analyzing phishing emails.
- Develop hands-on skills: examining email content, headers, sender analysis.

## What is Phishing?

- **Phishing** = Social engineering to steal info via email, SMS, calls, etc.
- Common goals:
  - Steal credentials or sensitive data.
  - Deliver malware (via links or attachments).
- Targets **humans**, the "weakest link" in security.
- Attackers cast a wide net → just one successful click can cause a breach.

## Role of the SOC Analyst

- First responders to phishing emails.
- Must quickly detect, analyze, and respond.
- Need solid methodology + technical knowledge + documentation skills.

## Human Principles Exploited in Phishing

Phishing leverages **social engineering** based on human psychology:

- **Authority**: Impersonates CEO/IT to compel action (e.g. gift card requests).
- **Trust**: Uses realistic logos, language, brands to build credibility.
- **Intimidation**: Uses threats (legal, account suspension) to force action.
- **Social Proof**: Mentions others have taken similar action ("Thousands of users...").
- **Urgency**: “Immediate action required” triggers fast, careless responses.
- **Scarcity**: “Limited-time offer” → fear of missing out (FOMO).
- **Familiarity**: Appears to be from known contacts or companies (especially via compromised inboxes).
